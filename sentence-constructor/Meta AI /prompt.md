# **📝 AI Japanese Sentence Constructor – Meta AI Prompt **  

## **📌 Overview**  
This is a **Meta AI prompt** designed to create an **AI-powered Japanese language tutor** that helps students **construct sentences** when the teacher isn’t around. Instead of just **translating**, this AI will **guide students step by step** through **sentence building, grammar breakdowns, and practice exercises** while keeping it **interactive and structured**.  

✔ **No direct translations** – guides students to figure it out.  
✔ **Structured format** – makes it easy to follow.  
✔ **Encourages active learning** – helps with sentence patterns, grammar, and vocabulary.  
✔ **Beginner to Intermediate (CEFR A2-B1)** – simple explanations, but flexible.  

We are using **Meta Llama 3 (70B)** from Meta AI to test out this approach. This model is accessible on **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B)** and provides a strong foundation for **text generation and structured responses** in AI-assisted language learning.
